# MyConsoleApplication

A beginner-friendly C# console application demonstrating string manipulation with detailed comments in each line of code. This artfully crafted project serves as a step-by-step guide, making it simpler and easier for newcomers to understand the process of creating and working with a C# console application.

A simple C# console application focusing on string manipulation:

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SifisoScS/MyConsoleApplication.git

## String Manipulation in C#
The project now includes code for practicing strings in C#. Below are examples of string manipulation:

// Creating and printing a string variable:
// 'string' is a data type in C# for representing text or character sequences.
// 'aFriend' is the name of the variable storing the string value "Simangaliso".

string aFriend = "Simangaliso";

// Console.WriteLine is a method for displaying text in the console.
// It's used here to print the value stored in the 'aFriend' variable.

Console.WriteLine(aFriend);

// Reassigning the value of aFriend and printing:
// The value of 'aFriend' is changed to "Simangaliso" again, and it's printed.

aFriend = "Simangaliso";
Console.WriteLine(aFriend); // As mentioned in in lines 7 and 8

Feel free to explore and experiment with the updated code for working with strings in C#.
