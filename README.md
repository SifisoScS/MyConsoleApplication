## String Manipulation in C#

The project now includes code for practicing strings in C#. Below are examples of string manipulation:

### Creating and Printing a String Variable

The `string` data type is used to represent text or character sequences in C#. `aFriend` is the name of the variable storing the string value `"Simangaliso"`. `Console.WriteLine` is a method for displaying text in the console. It's used here to print the value stored in the `aFriend` variable.

```csharp
string aFriend = "Simangaliso";
Console.WriteLine(aFriend);
```

### Reassigning the Value of aFriend and Printing

The value of `aFriend` is changed to `"Simangaliso"` again, and it's printed.

```csharp
aFriend = "Simangaliso";
Console.WriteLine(aFriend); // As mentioned in lines 7 and 8
```
